PHP - Login with Session and XML data access 
--------------------------------------------

This exercise should be done with little effort.

In terms of:
- use only plain PHP functions (no frameworks, external components etc)
- plain user interface (only the neccessary input fields, links, no special styling at all)


User  Interface:
----------------

Login-Screen

Simple website with a login formular. Fields:

  - Username
  - Passwort
  
Both fields must only accept a maximum amount of 10 characters.
The passwortfield has to mask the user input.


After-Login Screen

As soon as the user has been successfully authentificated, the site
shall show a "greeting page", to welcome the loged-in user:


  Hello [username]!
  
  Your last login has been: [dd-mm-yyyy H:i]
  
On this page there 's no other possibilities, except for this two links:

  - "log out" - user gets logged-out 
  - "Test" - this is just a testpage, which can only be reached if the user
  is logged-in. From this page there should also be the link to go back to
  the welcome page

Data:
-----

The login-data should be saved in a XML file:

  <xml>
    <user>
      <username>micha</username>
      <password>testmicha</password>
      <lastlogin>[dde-mm-yyyy h:i:s]</lastlogin>
     <user>

     <user>
      <username>christoph</username>
      <password>test123</password>
      <lastlogin>[dde-mm-yyyy h:i:s]</lastlogin>
     </user>
     
     <user>
      <username>claudia</username>
      <password>test456</password>
      <lastlogin>[dde-mm-yyyy h:i:s]</lastlogin>
     </user>
  </xml>
  
Everytime a user wants to login, this XML file should be read to
enable user authentification (check credentials).

More user can be added at any time, by extending this file.

After every successful login, the last login date shall be saved in the XML structur.


Authentification:
-----------------
Please work with a PHP Session
