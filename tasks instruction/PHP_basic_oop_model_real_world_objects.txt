PHP - OOP Basic Example - model classes based on real world objects
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A short exercise to deepen the gained knowledge from the last PHP OOP basic exercise.

- Car
- Balls
- Astronaut		| each of this, the astronaut
- Minion		| and the minion are considered to be humanoid
- Elephant (orange and black)
- Duck

Foreach of those please design:
- a class
-- at least two properties (plus the related getter/setter to set the property values)
-- at least one method (beside of the constructor)

Think about generalization and specialization (when it makes sence). Think about interfaces and abstract classe (if it makes any sense).
