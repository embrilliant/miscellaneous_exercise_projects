Exercise - Coding Kata Kanban Board
-----------------------------------

Your team needs a digital Kanban board urgently.

So create a board with columns for To Do, In Progress, Review and Done.

New tasks are set in the column To Do and are moved to the next right column, if there is not already reached the WIP limit.

Tasks has to be taken by team members in the moment they move it to In Progress.

Visualize the board as you like.

Some constrains
---------------
- build with JavaScript
- use OOP approach
	-- build appropriate objects
	-- aim for loose coupling of objects (e.g. make use of dependency injection and such)
	-- separate logic from layout
- Testdriven (write tests first)
	-- use mocha.js - the browser version

Bonus, as you like
-------------------
- the basic version don't need any data persistence, but as a bonus, you can write all data to local storage (HTML5) and restore every data once the user is visiting the app again

You could introduce a small field where one could drop and drag a picture from the local computer.

The picture will be uploaded, to be used as new wallpaper
